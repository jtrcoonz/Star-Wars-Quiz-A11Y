# Star-Wars-Quiz-A11Y
Refactored JS quiz from Introduction to Web Development to be accessible, using aXe.

NOTE: On the feedback pages, under the code responsible for the GIFs, I am unable to add a lang attribute to the HTML tags located within the <iframe> tag, because that code is generated when the page renders, and is not present in my local file's code. Other than that, I fixed all critical violations and left some of the moderate "needs review" flags, such as background color being untestable due to my background image.
